Evaluation scripts for real life exhaust gas measurements
===============================================================

These scripts are used to compute the average NO_x production (keeping
in mind their fuel consumption) of vehicles on German highways. The
scripts were written as part of a job at the Institute of
Environmental Physics, Heidelberg University, Germany.

There are two resources which have to be combined by the scripts to
yield the results. Firstly, there are the csv-files containing the
measurement timestamps together with additional meta data. Secondly,
there are the csv-files containing the trace gas time series.

As soon as the project grows I will start to explain the different
scripts in more detail to give an imperssion of the intended workflow.
